2:T52b,<p>When you first become eligible for Medicare, you quickly discover there isn’t just “one” Medicare plan. There are different parts, different plan types, and different ways to get your coverage.</p>
<p>Original Medicare (Parts A and B) covers many hospital and medical services, but it does not pay 100% of your costs. There are deductibles, coinsurance, and no annual maximum out-of-pocket limit. That’s where Medigap and Medicare Advantage come in: they’re two different ways of managing those gaps.</p>
<p>A <strong>Medicare Advantage</strong> plan (Part C) is an all-in-one alternative to Original Medicare. These plans are offered by private insurance companies and usually combine hospital, medical, and often prescription drug coverage.</p>
<p>A <strong>Medigap policy</strong>, on the other hand, works with Original Medicare. You can generally see any provider that accepts Medicare, which can feel very flexible.</p>
<p>There is no one-size-fits-all answer. Some people prefer the structure and extra benefits that may come with certain Medicare Advantage plans, while others value the flexibility and predictability of Medigap.</p>
<p>During a coverage review, I walk through how each option would work with your doctors, medications, and budget so you can decide which path feels right for you.</p>
