2:T6d7,<p>When comparing health plans, many people focus on the monthly premium. While the premium is important, it’s only one part of the picture. Understanding <strong>deductibles, copays, and coinsurance</strong> can help you avoid surprise costs throughout the year.</p>
<p>A <strong>deductible</strong> is the amount you pay before your insurance begins covering certain services. Some plans apply the deductible to everything; others apply it only to certain types of care, such as hospital stays or specialist visits. The size of the deductible often affects the premium — lower deductibles usually mean higher monthly costs.</p>
<p><strong>Copays</strong> are fixed amounts you pay for certain services, such as $20 for a primary care visit or $10 for a generic prescription. Copays are predictable and can make budgeting easier, especially if you visit the doctor regularly.</p>
<p><strong>Coinsurance</strong> is a percentage you pay for services after meeting your deductible. For example, you might pay 20% of the cost of an MRI, while the plan covers the other 80%. Coinsurance can vary significantly between plans, so it’s worth reviewing carefully.</p>
<p>One of the most important numbers on any plan is the <strong>maximum out-of-pocket limit</strong>. This is the most you would pay in a year for covered services, regardless of your deductible or coinsurance. Once you reach this limit, the plan pays 100% of covered costs for the rest of the year.</p>
<p>If these terms still feel overwhelming, don’t worry — most people feel the same way. During a coverage review, I can walk you through how each of these costs would apply to your situation, helping you choose a plan that fits both your healthcare needs and your budget.</p>
