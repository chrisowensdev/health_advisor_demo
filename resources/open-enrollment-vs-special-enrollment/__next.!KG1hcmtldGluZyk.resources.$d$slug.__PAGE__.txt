2:T5d1,<p>Understanding when you can change your health or Medicare plan is one of the most common questions people have. While the rules can feel confusing, they mostly fall into two major categories: <strong>Open Enrollment</strong> and <strong>Special Enrollment Periods</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Open Enrollment</strong> is the time each year when most people can freely switch plans, review benefits, or make changes for the coming year. For Medicare, this period typically runs from October 15 to December 7. For ACA Marketplace plans, it usually runs from November 1 to mid-January, though dates can vary by state.</p>
<p>If you miss Open Enrollment, you may still have options through a <strong>Special Enrollment Period (SEP)</strong>. SEPs are triggered by specific life events that significantly change your coverage needs or eligibility. Examples include moving to a new state or county, losing employer coverage, marriage or divorce, or aging into Medicare.</p>
<p>What many people don’t realize is that <strong>moving</strong> is one of the most common qualifying events for SEPs. Even a move within the same state can affect your available plan options. It’s always a good idea to check what plans are available in your new ZIP code.</p>
<p>If you’re unsure whether a recent change qualifies you for a Special Enrollment Period, that’s exactly what I’m here for. A short conversation can help clarify your options and make sure you don’t miss an important deadline.</p>
