When comparing health plans, many people focus on the monthly premium. While the premium is important, it’s only one part of the picture. Understanding **deductibles, copays, and coinsurance** can help you avoid surprise costs throughout the year.

A **deductible** is the amount you pay before your insurance begins covering certain services. Some plans apply the deductible to everything; others apply it only to certain types of care, such as hospital stays or specialist visits. The size of the deductible often affects the premium — lower deductibles usually mean higher monthly costs.

**Copays** are fixed amounts you pay for certain services, such as $20 for a primary care visit or $10 for a generic prescription. Copays are predictable and can make budgeting easier, especially if you visit the doctor regularly.

**Coinsurance** is a percentage you pay for services after meeting your deductible. For example, you might pay 20% of the cost of an MRI, while the plan covers the other 80%. Coinsurance can vary significantly between plans, so it’s worth reviewing carefully.

One of the most important numbers on any plan is the **maximum out-of-pocket limit**. This is the most you would pay in a year for covered services, regardless of your deductible or coinsurance. Once you reach this limit, the plan pays 100% of covered costs for the rest of the year.

If these terms still feel overwhelming, don’t worry — most people feel the same way. During a coverage review, I can walk you through how each of these costs would apply to your situation, helping you choose a plan that fits both your healthcare needs and your budget.
