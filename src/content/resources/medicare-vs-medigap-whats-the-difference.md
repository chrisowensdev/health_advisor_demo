When you first become eligible for Medicare, you quickly discover there isn’t just “one” Medicare plan. There are different parts, different plan types, and different ways to get your coverage.

Original Medicare (Parts A and B) covers many hospital and medical services, but it does not pay 100% of your costs. There are deductibles, coinsurance, and no annual maximum out-of-pocket limit. That’s where Medigap and Medicare Advantage come in: they’re two different ways of managing those gaps.

A **Medicare Advantage** plan (Part C) is an all-in-one alternative to Original Medicare. These plans are offered by private insurance companies and usually combine hospital, medical, and often prescription drug coverage.

A **Medigap policy**, on the other hand, works with Original Medicare. You can generally see any provider that accepts Medicare, which can feel very flexible.

There is no one-size-fits-all answer. Some people prefer the structure and extra benefits that may come with certain Medicare Advantage plans, while others value the flexibility and predictability of Medigap.

During a coverage review, I walk through how each option would work with your doctors, medications, and budget so you can decide which path feels right for you.
