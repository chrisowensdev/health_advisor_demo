Prescription drug coverage is an important part of managing your health, especially if you take medications regularly. Medicare offers drug coverage through **Part D plans** and through many **Medicare Advantage plans** that include prescription benefits. While these plans share some basics, the details can vary significantly.

Every Part D plan has a **formulary**, which is a list of covered medications. These formularies organize medications into **tiers**, often with lower-cost generics in Tier 1 and higher-cost brand-name or specialty medications in higher tiers. The tier your medication falls into affects your copay or coinsurance.

Plans also differ in their **preferred pharmacy networks**. Using a preferred pharmacy can lower your out-of-pocket costs, while using a non-preferred pharmacy may result in higher copays or coinsurance. Some plans also offer mail-order options, which can be convenient and cost-effective for maintenance medications.

You may have heard about the **coverage gap**, or “donut hole,” which affects how much you pay for prescriptions at certain spending levels. While recent changes have reduced the financial impact for many people, it’s still helpful to understand how your plan handles costs throughout the year.

Because prescription needs vary so much from person to person, choosing a drug plan often comes down to your specific medications, doses, and preferred pharmacies. During a Medicare drug plan review, I use tools to compare costs across plans so you can choose the one that best fits your needs.

If you’d like help reviewing your prescriptions or comparing Part D plans, I’m here to make the process easier and more understandable.
